/*
Question 1 is 100%, question 2 is 95%, question 3 is 80%, question 4 is 95%, and question 5 is 75%.
I think the reasons questions 3 and 5 have lower completion rates are because customers may not know what shapes they prefer without trying them on and customers
might not know the last time they had an eye exam or embarassed by how long its been since their last exam.*/

--With the data combined into one table, using the left join, it is possible to see the churn rate of the funnel and usersâ€™ decisions.
The first query shows that 75% of the initial 1,000 users chose to do a home try on. Of those , users were split roughly 50/50 between choosing 3 and 5 pairs.
Of the users that chose 3 pairs, 53% ended up making a purchase, and of the users that chose 5 pairs, 79% made a purchase.
This data strongly suggests that letting customers choose 5 pairs of glasses to try on at home leads to more purchases.
